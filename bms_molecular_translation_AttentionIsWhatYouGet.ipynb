        " \n",
        " - Image Encoder from [*Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention*](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/xuc15.pdf).  Generate image feature vectors using intermediate layer outputs from a pretrained CNN. (Here I use the more modern EfficientNet model (recommended by [*Darien Schettler*](https://www.kaggle.com/dschettler8845/bms-efficientnetv2-tpu-e2e-pipeline-in-3hrs/notebook)) with fixed weights and a trainable Dense layer for customization.)\n",

Includes parameters to control number of encoder / decoder blocks.\n",

        " - ***PLUS*** *(optional):* Decoder Output Blocks placed in Series (not stacked). Increase the number of trainable parameters without adding inference computational complexity, while also allowing decoders to specialize on different regions of the output.\n",
        " \n",
        " - ***PLUS*** *(optional):* Is attention really all you need? Add a convolutional layer to enhance text features before decoder self-attention to experiment with performance differences with and without extra convolutional layer(s). Use of CNN's in NLP comes from [*Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning*](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gehring17a.html.)\n",
        "\n",
        " - ***PLUS*** *(optional):* Beam-Search Alternative, an extra decoding layer applied after the full logits prediction has been made. This takes the form of a bidirectional RNN with attention, applied to the full logits sequence. Because a full (initial) prediction has already been made, computations can be parallelized using statefull RNNs. (See more details below.)\n",

However, it is *very* local in that computation expense increases quickly with the number of character steps taken into account. This is also a hard-coded algorithm, which is somewhat contrary to the philosophy of deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A *Beam-search Alternative* would be an extra decoding layer applied *after* the full logits prediction has been made. This might be in the form of a stateful, bidirectional RNN that is computationally parallizable because it is applied to the full logits sequence.\n",
